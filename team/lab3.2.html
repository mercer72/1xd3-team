        <h1>The bad:</h1>
        <p>
            An example of a bad website we took inspiration from (to not make the same mistakes) is
            <a id="showcase-link" href="https://www2.pnwx.com/" target="_blank">Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc</a>.
            The main issues come down to its aesthetic and flexibility.
            Aesthetics wise, the text is hard to see and navigate, the same image is used for every link making it hard
            to navigate quickly. Simply put, it does not follow the idea of ease of navigation, as well a lot of the
            contrasts
            make it hard to see links that bring you to the home page, or anywhere for that matter. Flexibility wise it
            clearly
            was not built with mobile use in mind, their method of making it accessible is just scaling the webpage down
            like
            you would a png. This makes it very hard to read the text and navigate as the links also become smaller.
            If they where to do this correctly sections should appear and disappear, and or be reimagined as screens
            get smaller, but sadly there is no evidence of that here.

        <h1>The good:</h1>
        <p>
            An example of a good website we took inspiration from is <a id="showcase-link" href="https://www.YouTube.com" target="_blank">YouTube</a> every good design practice is shown here.
            Firstly consistency, YouTube’s design is the same no matter what page you’re viewing, rather than be the
            main page,
            shorts tab, search, or even the new games tab. There is always a header and side bar as well as the logo and
            nav
            bars, this leads well into the ease of navigation. YouTube always presents its search bar to you, as well it
            does
            not need to be an exact search, YouTube will match the most likely videos to be relevant to your search.
            Besides
            this, as mentioned before, the nav bar is always there, this makes it so you can reach any other page with
            one
            simple click. Each section is also well defined, as in just by reading the title you know exactly what
            should
            be on the page, and that page indeed in more cases than not has what you need. There is also the good
            practice
            of universal usability and accessibility, YouTube will scale itself completely changing layout
            (still is an easy way to navigate) based on your screen size. As well you can change your theme,
            this lets you change contrasts, make the website easier on the eyes etc. The base contrast is also good,
            using mostly black and white with large fonts. There is also good examples of error prevention,
            occasionally you may see a box pop up telling you why a video wont load so the user can troubleshoot,
            as well internal system errors are never made prevalent to the user, unless in the rare case their servers
            are down.
